# Simple Project

This is a simple project intended to assist you with getting
comfortable with using your IDE, GitHub, and Maven.

# Instructions

First, you need to log into GitHub (which you seem to have already
done...) and fork this project so that you will have your own
copy of the code on GitHub.

Next, using your IDE of choice, clone your *forked copy* of the
project into your workspace.

After you have cloned the project, use Maven to build/test your
code. Make sure you are using Maven to perform the testing! Your
IDE will most likely build the code for you as well, but you need
to make sure that the project can be properly built with Maven as
well.

Finally, identify the error in the code, fix it, make sure your
test passes with Maven, commit/push the changes back to GitHub.

# Note

You must not change the name of the repository when you fork it, or
else the automated grading will not work properly.

# Extra

We will soon be looking at Travis CI as another convenient tool, but
it is not required for this project. If you would like to prepare for
what is coming in the future, though, feel free to log into Travis
and check your build process there!
